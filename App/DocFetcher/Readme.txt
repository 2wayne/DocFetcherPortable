Requirements
========================================
A Java Runtime Environment (JRE), version 1.6.0 or higher, is required. To find
out what JRE version you have, open a command prompt and type in
"java -version". If Java 1.6.0 or higher is not available on your system, you
can obtain it in the following places:
- Windows: http://java.com
- Linux: In the official software repository of your distribution.
- Mac OS X: http://www.apple.com/support/


How to start DocFetcher
========================================
Windows:
If DocFetcher was installed (i.e. non-portable), launch it via the DocFetcher
shortcut in your start menu. If you're instead using the portable version of
DocFetcher, double-click on DocFetcher.exe.
Note that portable DocFetcher may not work properly if you extract it into a
folder for which you don't have write permissions, e.g. into "C:\Program Files".

Linux:
Launch the program via DocFetcher.sh. If nothing happens or a text editor shows
up, make sure the executable flag has been set on the DocFetcher.sh file. If
that doesn't work either, you might see a helpful error mesage if you start
DocFetcher.sh from the terminal.

Mac OS X:
Launch the program by double-clicking on the DocFetcher application bundle.
